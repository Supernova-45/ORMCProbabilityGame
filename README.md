# ORMC Probability Game

You are on a game show where you receive 10,000 if you win and nothing if you lose. The game is played on a simple board: a track with sequential spaces numbered from 0 to 1,000. The zero space is marked ”start,” and you token is placed on it. You are handed a fair six-sided die and three coins. You are allowed to place the coins on three different non-zero spaces. Once placed, the coins may not be moved. After placing the three coins, you roll the die and mvoe your token forward the appropriate number of spaces. If, after moving the token, it lands on a space with a coin on it, you win. If not, roll again and continue moving forward. If you token passes all three coins without landing on one, you lose. On whichthree spaces should you place the coins to maximize your chances of winning?
